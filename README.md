# ArrowType Glyphs Scripts

Just a few tiny scripts that I’m putting together to do simple things in Glyphs. In the past, I would write various macros and then just kind of delete them, but lately I’ve been trying to formalize these just a bit. This will probably grow over time.

Nothing here is warranteed. Use at your own discretion.

## Installing these scripts in Glyphs

1. Download the “source code” zip from the [latest release](https://github.com/arrowtype/arrowtype-glyphs-scripts/releases/latest).
2. In Glyphs, go to the menu and then Scripts > Open Scripts Folder. This should open `/Users/YOUR_USER_NAME/Library/Application Support/Glyphs 3/Scripts` in Finder.
3. Drag the newly downloaded folder into that Scripts folder.
4. Finally, back in Glyphs, hold Option and go to the menu item Scripts > Reload Scripts. The scripts should now appear!

Alternatively, you can Git Clone this repo into your scripts folder, which will make it slightly easier to update periodically. But, you could also just download it again and replace the folder.
