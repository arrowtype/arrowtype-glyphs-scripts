# Arrow Type Glyphs Scripts

Just a few tiny scripts that I’m putting together to do simple things in Glyphs. In the past, I would write various macros and then just kind of delete them, but lately I’ve been trying to formalize these just a bit. This will probably grow over time.

Nothing here is warranteed. Use at your own discretion.
